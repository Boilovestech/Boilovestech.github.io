								<p>Good day! I am an enthusiastic Python developer who has a keen interest in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data sciences. My path in the world of technology can be attributed to my never-ending curiosity about the hidden meaning of data.

									That's why I build applications with Streamlit; itâ€™s one tool in which I have no troubles developing complex interactive web apps yet its straightforward nature makes it loveable. I also try to enjoy this language by creating everything from dynamic visualizations to complex models whenever possible.
									
									I carry out my research using scikit-learn, as it is a great framework when it comes to cultivated machine learning applications. My other finds include more advanced topics as model tuning of various transformer architectures as well as recent AI trends.
									
									Away from writing codes, I spend a lot of my time engaging in different data science techniques, which I have learned from reading research articles, and also working on projects that require these techniques. I cannot wait to get my hands on, and work on a project with others who love technology for how it can change the world.</p>
